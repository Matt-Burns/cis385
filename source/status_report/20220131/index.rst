Week 2 Ending 2022-01-31
========================

Weekly Check-In
---------------
| Experiments require a large number of active and distinct users to produce results.
  `Python Arcade Library <https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/>`_ has roughly 150ish active users.
  Will attempt to integrate Python Arcade Library with Optimizely.
| Python Arcade Library Source: `GitHub <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/blob/maintenance/doc/index.rst>`_

Weekly Actions
--------------
* Configured Active Optimizely experiment for the first time *4.5h*
* Added a handy Flask local development tip: :doc:`/flask/index` *2h* (doc references causing me probs, I am rethinking the overall layout of the site)
* Created Web Experiment Walkthrough :doc:`/optimizely/index` *3h* (This actually took my entire Sunday afternoon and evening. I just could not settle on how I wanted to format the work I did. I will clear this up by next week.)
