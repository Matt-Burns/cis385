A Simple Optimizely Web Experiment
==================================
| The website `www.yukencreations.com`_ receives regular visits, however, very few visitors explore the site past the home page.
  Through a series of life compromises you are now a UX Designer employed with www.yukencreations.com.
  Management proposes correcting the verbiage of the home page top header to Yuken Creations.
  It currently reads Ceramic Studio.
  They believe having the header text match the domain name will give new visitors the confidence needed to explore.
  You think the proposed verbiage correction will not result in increased exploration and want to encourage the team not to pursue this option.
  You fire up the Optimizely Web Experiment platform and get to work!

Hypothesis
----------
| Correcting the home page top header to Yuken Creations will result in more new visitors exploring the site.

Test
----
| For the next 10 days direct each new visitor to either the existing home page or the corrected home page and record if the user continued further in to the app.
  Analyze the data investigating trends, patterns, and relationships.
