A Simple Optimizely Web Experiment
==================================
| Optimizely has a great `support article <https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410289104013-Six-steps-to-create-an-experiment-in-Optimizely-Web>`_ to configuring and activating a Web Experiment.
  It provides everything one needs to know in order to have Web Experiments up and running easily with no guesswork.
  `Optimizely Web Experimentation <https://www.optimizely.com/products/intelligence/web-experimentation/>`_ requires access to the Optimizely Web Experiment client.
  Unfortunately the web client is not free, however be sure to check out  `Optimizely Web Experimentation <https://www.optimizely.com/products/intelligence/web-experimentation/>`_, and push the Get Started button to find more information on how you can get started creating your own Web Experiments.

The Premise / Goals
-------------------
| What follows in the next section is a "Quick Start/Cheat Sheet" type of guide for an imaginary new Web Experiment Client user.
  The imaginary user understands Web Experimentation as a concept, is unsure of it's benefits, and has no experience with Optimizely Web Experimentation or any other similar platform.
  The goal of "Quick Start/Cheat Sheet" then, is to provide the exact series of steps required to quickly configure and activate a Web Experiment involving `bounce rate <https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410289372813-Bounce-rate-and-exit-rate-metrics#Bounce_rate>`_ as compared against two possible `yukencreations.com <https://www.yukencreations.com>`_ home page options.
  Think of it as a streamlined version of the Optimizely support article `Six-steps-to-create-an-experiment-in-Optimizely-Web <https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410289104013-Six-steps-to-create-an-experiment-in-Optimizely-Web>`_.
  Should you have access to the Optimizely Web Experiment Client feel free to use this guide to set up your first experiment.
  Should you not have access hopefully you can get a feel for the simplicity and potential value of Web Experimentation.
