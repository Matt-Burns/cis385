The Author

I am a Software Engineer with roughly 20 years professional experience creating, maintaining, and improving Web Applications. I've had the opportunity to work with many web development tools and concepts. If it involves front end, back end, database, messaging, services, batch, performance, optimization, monitoring, CI/CD, I've done it. My current focus is A/B testing with the Optimizely Web Experimentation platform.
