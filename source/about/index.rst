The Author
----------

I am a Software Engineer with roughly 20 years professional experience creating, maintaining, and improving Web Applications. I've had the opportunity to work with many web development tools and concepts. If it involves front end, back end, database, messaging, services, batch, performance, optimization, monitoring, CI/CD, I've done it. My current focus is A/B testing with the Optimizely Web Experimentation platform.

The Project

The goal of the project is simple. Help me understand how Optimizely leverages A/B testing and Artificial Intelligence to facilitate Web Experimentation. Read more about `Optimizely Web Experimentation <https://www.optimizely.com/products/intelligence/web-experimentation>`_.
